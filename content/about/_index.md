I'm a postdoctoral scientist at the newly founded Roche Institute for Human Biology in Basel, Switzerland. I recently graduated from ETH Zürich with a Ph.D. in Computational & Systems Biology. During my PhD in the lab of Barbara Treutlein I used and developed statistical and machine learning methods to decipher the gene regulatory logic of cell fate decisions in brain organoids. My PhD work was also supported by a Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds fellowship. 

Before that, I worked as a Master student in the group of Georg Zeller at EMBL Heidelberg, where I developed a method for prediction of biosynthetic gene clusters from metagenomic assemblies using conditional random fields.

I am excited about harnessing the power of high-throughput biology using machine learning. By combining in vitro generated organoid systems, high information content (single-cell) phenotyping, and ML/DL, we can significantly advance predictive biology.
