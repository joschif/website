I'm a postdoctoral scientist with Gray Camp at the [Institute of Human Biology](https://institutehumanbiology.com/) in Basel. I'm collaborating with Aviv Regev to develop predictive ML models for high-thoughput perturbation screens in organoids and with Fabian Theis to assemble integrated single-cell genomic atlases of various organoid systems. 

I recently graduated from ETH Zürich with a Ph.D. in Computational & Systems Biology. During my PhD in the lab of Barbara Treutlein I applied and developed statistical and machine learning methods to decipher the gene regulatory logic of cell fate decisions in brain organoids. My PhD work was also supported by a Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds fellowship. 

Before that, I worked as a Master student in the group of Georg Zeller at EMBL Heidelberg, where I developed a method for prediction of biosynthetic gene clusters from metagenomic assemblies using conditional random fields.

I am excited about the intersection of high-throughput biology and machine learning and I am convinced that it will revolutionize biology towards a more predictive science. I am always open for collaborations and new ideas, so feel free to reach out to me via email or social media.
